# This file contains new (to us) RuboCop rules which have yet to be implemented.

# This rule can be implemented automatically, but it's a large diff.

# This rule is only disabled because there are currently too many
# violations. This rule can't be automatically fixed, but it can be fixed by
# hand without much thought. You only need to nest inside module blocks, instead
# of Module::Class style.

# This rule is only disabled because there are currently too many violations. It
# would be nice to be able to enable this one though, as many other RuboCop
# rules use this rule for their automatic-formatting feature.

# Decide whether we ever want to implement this particular rule. It requires all

# This is probably a good rule to implement and we only have these few

# "Grandfathered" Exceptions
#
# This section contains exceptions for certain, older files. For the most part,
# these are the files which violated some rules so badly when we began to use
# RuboCop that there wasn't time to fix them. Someday a hero will come and make
# these files compiant, so they can be removed from these lists.
#
# You may add new entries here, but please an aproriate amount of shame when
# doing so.
